#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have made the list of the quotes said by the five characters I am using for the game:
Walter, Jesse, Saul Goodman, Hank, and Gus. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

As for what I have not done, I have yet to write the code that asks the user to guess who said the quote 
given. I also need to find pictures of each of the characters and write the portion of the program that 
displays the photo if the user guessed correctly. The option to guess again or give up will also be given 
if the user guesses incorrectly. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No problems encountered yet!
