## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

One of the ideas that I had for my final project is to have a game that gives the user a quote
from the TV show "Breaking Bad" and has the user guess which character said it.
I am  hoping to also include images from breaking bad that indicate whether or not the users input is correct.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not at the moment.
