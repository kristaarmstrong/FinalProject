# FinalProject
One of the biggest difficulties I encountered whilst completing this project was getting the program to display a photo of the character that said the quote after the users guesses correctly. Due to the fact that this is my first time taking a programming class ever, I am not completely sure if there was something up with my computer, or if I was simply not following the necessary steps to correctly program that outcome. So, I decided to change the game to display a fun fact about the character instead of the photo.

Some of the things I learned from this project is to take your time when writing a code because the time spend looking for corrections could be avoided(hopefully) when the code is written slower. 

The thing I enjoyed most about this project was seeing my code actually work. I know the game I created is not the most challenging code to write, but at the beginnning this course i definitely would not have known where to even start for this project. It was also fun finding fun quotes and facts about the characters used in this game.
